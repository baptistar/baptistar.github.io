Starting in Fall 2025, I am an Assistant Professor in [Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca) at the University of Toronto and a Faculty Affiliate at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). My research is on probabilistic modeling and inference for problems in science and engineering. Most recently, I have been developing and analyzing generative models based on computational measure transport.

Bio: Before Toronto, I was a von Kármán instructor at Caltech in [Computing + Mathematical Sciences](http://cms.caltech.edu) and a Postdoctoral Scientist at [Amazon Search](https://www.amazon.science). I completed my PhD at MIT in Computational Science and Engineering where I was fortunate to be advised by [Youssef Marzouk](http://uqgroup.mit.edu). A copy of my thesis can be found [here](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/145049). Before MIT, I received my BASc in [Engineering Science](http://engsci.utoronto.ca) from the University of Toronto.
